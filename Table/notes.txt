==> how to create a Tables.

==> what kind of information suits tables.

==> how to represent complex data in tables. 
   
==> there are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table.

     example:  sports results, stock reports and train timetable.

==> when you representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a grid made up of rows

    and columns. 

==> use the four key elements of creating tables.

==> represent complex data using tables.

==> add caption to tables.

==> table element is used to create a table.

==> the starts of each row using <tr> tag.

==> it is followed by one or more <td> elements. (one ofr each cell in that row)

==> each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (the td stands for table data).

        example:

                 <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                           Ashok
                        </td>
                        <td>
                           Ash
                        </td>
                        <td>
                           hari
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

==> th stands for table heading used just like the td element but its purpose is to represent the 

    heading for either a colum or a row.

==> even if a cell has no content, you should still use a <td> or <th> element represent the purpose of 

    any empty cell otherwise the table has will not render correctly.

==> using <th> elements for headings helps people who use screen readers, improves the ability for search 

    engines to index you are pages.

==> you can use the scope attribute on the <th> element to indicate whether it is a heading for a colum or row.

==> it can takes the values : row to indicate the heading of the row or colum indicate a heading of a colum.

spanning columns:
=================

==> sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one colum.

==> the colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element that indicates how many columns that cell
    
    should run across.

spanning rows:
===============

==> the rowspan attribute can be used i na <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should

    span down the table.

long tables:
=============
  
==> the headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element.

==> the <tbody> should sits inside the <tbody> element.

==> the footer belongs to inside the <tfoot> element.
